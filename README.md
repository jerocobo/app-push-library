# app-push-library

A Library for Android MDM clients to push applications to the device. The library can be integrated with any mobile applications to accept app install messages through FCM.

#### Integrating the Library

Add the library in the dependencies section:

``` gradle
dependencies {
    ...
    compile 'com.multunus:apppusher:0.1'
}
```

In the applicationâ€™s main activity `onCreate` method, start the onemdm-installer service as follows:

``` java
public void onCreate() {
    ...
    AppPusher.init();
}
```

#### Pushing App to the Devices

Here is the format of FCM message to push an app to the device:

``` json
{
    "type": "app_install",
    "name": "<App Name>",
    "url": "<APK URL>"
}
```

Once the message is delivered, the device will download the application and prompt the user to install it.
